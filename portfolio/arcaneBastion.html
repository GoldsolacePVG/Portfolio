      <p class="text-base sm:text-lg leading-relaxed">
        Arcane Bastion: Endless Horde is a playable demo that serves as a prototype for what could potentially become a full-fledged title in the future. 
        This project was developed as part of a course within the Video Game Programming degree at ESAT, with the goal of applying knowledge acquired in 
        the use of the Unreal Engine 5.<br><br> The game belongs to the "survivor-like" genre, inspired by wave-based survival games, but it offers a more 
        strategic and slower-paced approach compared to other titles in the genre. Everything takes place in a fully 3D environment, where the player must 
        face successive waves of enemies while progressively upgrading the main character's abilities and stats.<br><br> The core objective is simple yet 
        challenging: survive as many waves as possible, using both the layout of the environment and the upgrades acquired to withstand the gradually increasing 
        difficulty.
